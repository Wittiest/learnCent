Peer to peer tutoring powered by recursive incentives

## Information
learnCent is founded on the simple idea of fixing a search problem at universities. Universities are notorious for inefficient spending. Students have problems getting help with homework. What if we could fix both of these problems?

Universities will stamp learnCent tokens for student use. Similar to university meal cards, students will receive these tokens at the beginning of a semester to spend on tutors. Universities benefit from a public ledger; students benefit from the entire student body being incentivized to recruit tutors for each other.

How are students incentivized to help? Simple. A request for a tutor will be powered by a recursive incentive where the individuals who referred the tutor or referred the person who referred the tutor (or referred that person...so on), will receive a portion of the initial budget allocated.
